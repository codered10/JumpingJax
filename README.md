My rendition of Google Chrome Dino Game, played by an AI.

## Overview
Recreated the game from scratch in Python using Pygame module and used NEAT-Python to teach AI to play this game.

## Instructions
Install the packages mentioned in requirements.txt file and run jump.py file. Sit back and see AI play the game to perfection!
